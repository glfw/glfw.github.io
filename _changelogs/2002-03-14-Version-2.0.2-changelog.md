- Added a makefile option for building for X11 with 'cc' rather than 'gcc'
  (useful for IRIX users for instance)
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: Mouse coordinates are now relative to the window upper left
  corner, which also means that disabling the mouse cursor in windowed mode
  should work much better
- \[X11\] Bugfix: Added a bunch of more keys that are recognized by GLFW
- \[X11\] Bugfix: `glfwGetNumberOfProcessors` now works for IRIX (earlier
  versions of GLFW would not compile under IRIX)
