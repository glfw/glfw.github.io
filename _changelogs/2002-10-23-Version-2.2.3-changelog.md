- Bugfix: Checking for `GL_SGIS_generate_mipmap` is more robust
- Bugfix: `glfwLoadTexture2D` will now fail if no window is opened
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: Right shift was not detected under Win 9x/ME (it is still
  not as good as under NT/2K/XP, but at least you get right shifts)
- \[X11\] Bugfix: Visuals are now selected more accurately. For instance,
  `glfwOpenWindow` will no longer fail if you request a 24-bit color buffer if
  only 16-bit color visuals are available (which means that pong3d should work
  on 16-bit displays).
