- Added OpenGL stereo rendering support
- Added a function for parsing the OpenGL version string (`glfwGetGLVersion`)
- \[x86\] Bugfix: Hopefully the CPU core clock dependent timer RDTSC will never
  be used on CPUs with variable core frequencies anymore
- \[X11\] Bugfix: GLFW could create stereo rendering capable windows, even if it
  was not requested (GLFW 2.2.x did not support selection of stereo rendering)
- \[X11\] Bugfix: `glfwGetProcAddress` returned NULL on most systems (even on
  those that supported `glXGetProcAddressARB`). Now GLFW assumes that
  `glXGetProcAddressARB` is supported on all systems, which solves the bug, but
  may result in compiler errors on some systems (please let me know if you have
  any related problems).
