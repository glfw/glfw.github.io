title: GLFW 2.1 changelog
description: List of notable changes made to the GLFW.
version: 2.1
tags: changelog
---

- Added image and texture loading capabilities (support for the TGA file format
  at the moment)
- Added a new example program (`mipmaps.c`) for showing off the automatic mipmap
  generation and texture loading capabilities of GLFW 2.1
- Removed the separate TGA loader (`tga.c` in the examples directory) since
  texture loading is supported natively by GLFW. Also updated the Pong3D demo to
  use GLFW texture loading instead of `tga.c`.
- Improved keyboard handling (e.g. numeric keypad keys can be detected)
- Added a new example program, `keytest.c`
- Changed the `GLFWvidmode` structure and the corresponding API functions to
  report pure color bits instead of the confusing (and unportable) "BPP" field
- Changed `glfwSetWindowSize` so that it operates in fullscreen mode too
- Added mouse wheel support under Windows (not Win95) and X11
- Added window iconification functions (`glfwInconifyWindow` and
  `glfwRestoreWindow`)
- Improved iconification and deactivation handling under both Windows and X11
- Made it possible to turn on/off key repeat (the default is now no key repeat)
- Added SGI hardware timer support (`CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE`) for improved timer
  resolution for SGI computers
- Added support for the free Borland C++ Builder 5.x compiler for Windows
- Made it possible to compiler GLFW as a Windows DLL using any of the supported
  compilers
- Some constants have changed names (e.g. `GLFW_REDBITS` is now called
  `GLFW_RED_BITS`)
- Updated GLFW documentation (GLFW Users Guide and GLFW Reference Manual) to
  reflect the changes in the API
