 - Added `GLFWcursor` custom system cursor handle
 - Added `glfwCreateCursor`, `glfwCreateStandardCursor`, `glfwDestroyCursor` and
   `glfwSetCursor` for managing system cursor images
 - Added `GLFWimage` struct for passing 32-bit RGBA images
 - Added monitor and adapter identifier access to native API
 - Added `glfwSetDropCallback` and `GLFWdropfun` for receiving dropped files
 - Added `glfwPostEmptyEvent` for allowing secondary threads to cause
   `glfwWaitEvents` to return

 - Added `glfwSetCharModsCallback` for receiving character events with modifiers
 - Added `glfwGetWindowFrameSize` for retrieving the size of the frame around
   the client area of a window
 - Added `GLFW_AUTO_ICONIFY` for controlling whether full screen windows
   automatically iconify (and restore the previous video mode) on focus loss
 - Added `GLFW_DONT_CARE` for indicating that any value is acceptable
 - Added `GLFW_DOUBLEBUFFER` for controlling whether to use double buffering
 - Added `GLFW_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR` and values
   `GLFW_ANY_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR`, `GLFW_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH` and
   `GLFW_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_NONE` for `GL_KHR_context_flush_control` support
 - Added `GLFW_INCLUDE_ES31` for including the OpenGL ES 3.1 header
 - Added `GLFW_FLOATING` for creating always-on-top windowed mode windows
 - Added `GLFW_FOCUSED` window hint for controlling initial input focus
 - Added *partial and experimental* support for Wayland
 - Added *partial and experimental* support for Mir
 - Changed the window state attributes (focused, iconified and visible) to query
   the system directly
 - Changed the default of `GLFW_REFRESH_RATE` to `GLFW_DONT_CARE` to maintain
   the default behavior
 - Changed static library to build as position independent code for easier use
   from the Rust language
 - Changed `glfwGetCursorPos` to query the system directly for all cursor modes
   except captured mode
 - Bugfix: The debug context attribute was set from `GL_ARB_debug_output` even
           when a debug context had not been requested

                     non-primary monitors
