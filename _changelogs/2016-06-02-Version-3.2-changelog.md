   keys
 - Added `glfwWaitEventsTimeout` for waiting for events for a set amount of time
 - Added `glfwSetWindowIcon` for setting the icon of a window

 - \[Win32\] Added support for Windows 8.1 per-monitor DPI
 - \[Win32\] Replaced winmm with XInput and DirectInput for joystick input
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: Window creation would segfault if video mode setting required
                     the system to be restarted
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: MinGW import library lacked the `lib` prefix
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: Monitor connection and disconnection events were not reported
                     when no windows existed
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: Activating or deactivating displays in software did not
                     trigger monitor callback
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: No monitors were listed on headless and VMware guest systems
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: Pressing Ctrl+Pause would report `GLFW_KEY_UNKNOWN`
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: Window size events would be reported in wrong order when
                     restoring a full screen window
 - \[Cocoa\] Made joystick polling more efficient
 - \[Cocoa\] Removed support for OS X 10.6
 - \[Cocoa\] Bugfix: Full screen windows on secondary monitors were mispositioned
 - \[Cocoa\] Bugfix: Connecting a joystick that reports no name would segfault
 - \[Cocoa\] Bugfix: Modifier flags cache was not updated when window became key
 - \[Cocoa\] Bugfix: Dead key character composition did not work
 - \[Cocoa\] Bugfix: The CGL context was not released until the autorelease pool
                     was drained by another function
 - \[X11\] Bugfix: Monitor connection and disconnection events were not reported
 - \[X11\] Bugfix: Decoding of UTF-8 text from XIM could continue past the end
 - \[X11\] Bugfix: An XKB structure was leaked during `glfwInit`
 - \[X11\] Bugfix: XInput2 `XI_Motion` events interfered with the Steam overlay
 - \[POSIX\] Bugfix: An unrelated TLS key could be deleted by `glfwTerminate`
 - \[Linux\] Made joystick polling more efficient
 - \[WGL\] Changed extension loading to only be performed once
 - \[WGL\] Removed dependency on external WGL headers
 - \[GLX\] Added `glfwGetGLXWindow` to query the `GLXWindow` of a window
 - \[GLX\] Replaced legacy drawable with `GLXWindow`
 - \[GLX\] Removed dependency on external GLX headers
 - \[GLX\] Bugfix: NetBSD does not provide `libGL.so.1`
 - \[EGL\] Added `_GLFW_USE_EGLPLATFORM_H` configuration macro for controlling
           whether to use an existing `EGL/eglplatform.h` header
