   loader linked statically into the application (#820)
 - Bugfix: Single compilation unit builds failed due to naming conflicts (#783)
 - Bugfix: The range checks for `glfwSetCursorPos` used the wrong minimum (#773)
 - Bugfix: Defining `GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN` when compiling the library did not
           fail with the expected error message (#823)
 - Bugfix: Inherited value of `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` was clobbered (#822)
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: `glfwSetClipboardString` created an unnecessary intermediate
                   copy of the string
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: Examples failed to build on Visual C++ 2010 due to C99 in
                   `linmath.h` (#785)
 - \[Win32\] Bugfix: The first shown window ignored the `GLFW_MAXIMIZED` hint
                   when the process was provided a `STARTUPINFO` (#780)
 - \[Cocoa\] Bugfix: Event processing would segfault on some machines due to
                   a previous distributed notification listener not being fully
                   removed (#817,#826)
 - \[Cocoa\] Bugfix: Some include statements were duplicated (#838)

                 was set to `GLFW_DONT_CARE` (#805)

                 `BadMatch` on some non-reparenting WMs (#789,#798)
 - \[X11\] Bugfix: `glfwGetWindowPos` and `glfwSetWindowPos` operated on the
                 window frame instead of the client area (#800)
 - \[WGL\] Added reporting of errors from `WGL_ARB_create_context` extension
 - \[GLX\] Bugfix: Dynamically loaded entry points were not verified
