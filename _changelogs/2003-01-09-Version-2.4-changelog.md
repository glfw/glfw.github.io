title: GLFW 2.4 changelog
description: List of notable changes made to the GLFW.
version: 2.4
tags: changelog
---

- Major source code rearrangement - much code is now shared between different
  platforms, and it should be easier to port GLFW to new platforms
- Added a Unicode keyboard text input interface (CharCallback)
- Keyboard key input is now slightly more internationalized: GLFW now uses 8-bit
  ISO-8859-1 encoding for keys representing printable characters (e.g.
  &quot;&Ouml;&quot;, &quot;&#167;&quot;, etc), as opposed to the previous 7-bit
  US-ASCII encoding
- Added more key constants (F13-F25, keypad '=')
- Added an enable/disable switch for automatic event polling from
  glfwSwapBuffers
- \[X11\] Added support for sysctl for querying the number of processors in the
  system (if POSIX sysconf is not supported)
- \[X11\] Bugfix: `compile.sh` now works with Sun sh (and hopefully others too)
- \[X11\] Bugfix: `compile.sh` now detects the need for `-ldl` when `dlopen` is
  used
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: When closing a fullscreen window under Win 9x/NT4, the task
  bar icon now disappears properly
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: GLFW should now compile on a wider range of MSVC compilers
  (e.g. .NET) - Thanks Tim Little!
