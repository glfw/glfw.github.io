title: Help, GLFW 2.7 is *still* nearly done
---

I (elmindreda) unfortunately have a very limited amount of time to spend
on GLFW.
[Version 2.7](http://glfw.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/glfw/trunk/)
is stable and better than 2.6 in pretty much every way, but there's still
[a few items left](http://wiki.glfw.org/wiki/TODO_for_GLFW_2.7).
If you have a little time to spare, please consider helping out with testing,
bug fixing or just moral support on [#glfw](community.html).
