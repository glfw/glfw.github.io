- Removed the silly limitation of 100 threads (the thread information is now
  kept in a linked list)
- General source cleanup (window state is now kept in a single struct, plus some
  other minor changes)
- \[X11\] Added Solaris `gethrtime` support (not tested yet), which should give
  an improved timer for Sun/Solaris stations
- \[X11\] Some fixes to the `compile.sh` script (`-O` for non-gcc compilers and
  `make x11-gcc` should now really force GCC)
