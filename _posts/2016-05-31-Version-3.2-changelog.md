 - \[Cocoa\] Bugfix: Dead key character composition did not work
 - \[Cocoa\] Bugfix: The CGL context was not released until the autorelease pool
                     was drained by another function
 - \[X11\] Bugfix: Monitor connection and disconnection events were not reported
 - \[X11\] Bugfix: Decoding of UTF-8 text from XIM could continue past the end
 - \[X11\] Bugfix: An XKB structure was leaked during `glfwInit`
