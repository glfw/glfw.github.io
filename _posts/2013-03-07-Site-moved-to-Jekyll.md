title: Site moved to Jekyll
---

This site now runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), an easy-to-use static page
generator.  The sources for the site are
[hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/elmindreda/glfw.www), and issues and pull
requests are enabled.

Through Jekyll, there's now also an [Atom feed](feed/index.xml) for GLFW news.
