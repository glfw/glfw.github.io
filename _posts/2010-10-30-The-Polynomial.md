[The Polynomial](http://dmytry.com/games/) is a 3D spaceflight music
game with abstract, mathematically generated scenery and models which are set to
the music of your choice. You fly around in a very strange universe, shoot the
enemies, meet and protect the friends, collect bonuses, fly through wormholes,
and so on, all while rocking out to the music.
