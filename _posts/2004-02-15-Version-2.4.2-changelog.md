title: 2.4.2
tag: changelog
---

- Preliminary native Mac OS X support (via the Carbon interface)
- Preliminary DOS support (DJGPP + Mesa)
- Changed license to the zlib license (almost identical to the previous GLFW
  license), so now GLFW is OSI Certified
- Rewrote the GLFW documentation in LaTeX, meaning several improvements (both
  visual and practical)
- Added the `support` folder to the distribution, which includes support for
  various languages
- \[Win32\] Added OpenWatcom compiler support (thanks Sebastian Schuberth!)
- \[Win32\] Changed fallback timer from `GetTickCount` to `timeGetTime`, which
  usually provides better resolution
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: Accumulator buffer selection should be more robust
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: If stereo rendering is requested, and no stereo pixel format
  could be created, `glfwOpenWindow` now fails
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: `glfwSetWindowSize` now sets the size of the client area,
  NOT the entire window, meaning that there is a 1:1 relationship between
  `glfwSetWindowSize` and `glfwGetWindowSize`
- \[X11\] Added FreeBSD and QNX support
- \[X11\] Added support for non-pthread capable systems
- \[X11\] Hopefully more robust configuration script (`compile.sh`)
- \[X11\] Bugfix: When mouse cursor is hidden, mouse sensitivity is no longer
  degraded
- \[X11\] Bugfix: Source files EOL was PC style (CR/LF) in Version 2.4.1 (blame my
  WinCVS configuration)
- \[X11\] Bugfix: When a GLFW window is closed, input focus is properly released
- \[X11\] Bugfix: Iconification of fullscreen windows should now work properly
- \[x86 CPUs\] Improved RDTSC timing (e.g. RDTSC support on single-CPU Intel
  Hyper-Threading enabled systems)
- \[AmigaOS\] Added joystick support
- \[AmigaOS\] Mouse cursor positioning is now implemented
- \[AmigaOS\] Added support for Geek Gadgets GCC
- \[AmigaOS\] Bugfix: `glfwGetWindowParam` now returns proper values for all
  parameters (except for `GLFW_ACCELERATED`)
