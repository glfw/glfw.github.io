GLFW 3.0 is available for download. 
It adds support for multiple windows, multiple monitors, clipboard text I/O,
gamma ramps, better error reporting, more event callbacks, undecorated windows,
joystick names, a new build system using CMake, UTF-8 for all strings,
experimental support for EGL and OpenGL ES and more.

GLFW 3.0 is *not* backwards compatible with 2.7, but there is a [transition
guide](/docs/3.0/moving.html) for moving to the new API.
