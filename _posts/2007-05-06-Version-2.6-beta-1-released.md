title: Version 2.6 beta 1 released
---

Well, it took a while (*way* too long, in fact), but the first beta
of GLFW version 2.6 has been released. The upside is that despite being a
beta, is stable enough to be a recommended upgrade for all users. It's not
finished, it's not perfect, but it's good. You can find it
[here](download.html).

Some of the highlights in version 2.6 are:
- Support for fullscreen antialiasing
- Support for non-resizable windows
- An expanded and improved image and texturing API
- Shared library, Universal binary and MinGW cross compiling build targets
- Installation build targets for Mac OS X and other Unix-like systems
- Much improved support for fullscreen windows on X11

Also note that this release obsoletes the AmigaOS and DOS platforms, due to
non-existent community and maintainer interest.
