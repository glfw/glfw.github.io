title: Version 3.0 Git repository opened
---

The chunk of code that will become version 3.0 can now be found in the
[Git repository](https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&group_id=72569)
at
[SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/glfw/develop).
Please note that it is (at the time of writing) very early in development and
that things may not work yet or even be present at all.  The current state of
the code is primarily intended to foster discussion.

Development of version 3.0 is coordinated via the
[glfw-dev](https://lists.stacken.kth.se/mailman/listinfo/glfw-dev)
mailing list.

There is a *preliminary*
[roadmap for 3.0](http://wiki.glfw.org/wiki/Roadmap_for_3.0) on
our wiki.
