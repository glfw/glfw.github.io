All GLFW repositories have been [moved to GitHub](https://github.com/glfw).
This includes the stable
[version 2.7](https://github.com/glfw/glfw-legacy), which has been migrated from
Subversion, the ongoing development for
[version 3.0](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and the
[sources for this site](https://github.com/glfw/website).  Move notices have
been added to the repositories on SourceForge.net.
