- Added joystick support (only supported under Windows so far)
- Added joystick controls to `pong3d.c` (only 3 more lines of code)
- Added `glfwOpenWindowHint` function
- It is now possible to specify a desired vertical monitor refresh rate (for
  fullscreen windows)
- It is now possible to request an accumulator buffer and auxiliary buffers
- Added `glfwSetTime` function
- Added a GLFW conversion of the MESA/GLUT gears.c demo to the example programs
- \[Win32\] `gdi32.dll` and `winmm.dll` are now loaded dynamically when `glfwInit`
  is called.  This means that there is no need to link with `gdi32.lib` or
  `winmm.lib` when using the static version of GLFW, which should make GLFW usage
  more convenient.
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: Greatly improved keyboard input (detect left/right CTRL etc)
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: `glfwExtensionSupported` now detects all WGL extensions
  (e.g. `WGL_ARB_pbuffer`)
- \[Win32\] Bugfix: Mouse cursor was not re-hidden when a GLFW window was
  deselected and then selected again (with ALT+TAB)
- \[X11\] Bugfix: Minor bug in the SGI timer - and ugly (unintended) SGI timer
  debug info removed
- \[X11\] Bugfix: `glfwGetDesktopMode` and `glfwGetVideoModes` no longer give
  segmentation faults if no X server is available
