## Introduction

### 1.1 - What is GLFW?

GLFW is a small C library that lets you create and manage windows, OpenGL
and OpenGL ES contexts and Vulkan surfaces, enumerate monitors and video modes
as well as handle inputs such as keyboard, mouse, joystick, clipboard and time.

GLFW provides a thin, multi-platform abstraction layer, primarily for
applications whose sole graphics output is through OpenGL, OpenGL ES or Vulkan.
While GLFW is very useful when developing multi-platform OpenGL applications,
single-platform developers can also benefit from avoiding having to deal with
kludgy platform-specific APIs.

Libraries like GLFW are useful because OpenGL and OpenGL ES by themselves do not
provide any mechanisms for creating the necessary context, managing windows,
user input, timing etc.  As stated in the OpenGL 3.1 Specification (chapter 2,
first paragraph):

> OpenGL is concerned only with rendering into a framebuffer (and reading values
> stored in that framebuffer). There is no support for other peripherals
> sometimes associated with graphics hardware, such as mice and keyboards.
> Programmers must rely on other mechanisms to obtain user input.

GLFW matches the description of *other mechanisms* quite well.

Unlike the GL APIs, Vulkan does provide its own instance and surface creation
functions, but surface creation is platform-specific and the API still only
covers rendering.


### 1.2 - What is GLFW not?

GLFW is *by design* not...

- an implementation of OpenGL, OpenGL ES or Vulkan.  It wraps the various
  platform-specific context and surface creation API.
- an OpenGL, OpenGL ES or Vulkan header.  It includes the API headers already
  provided by your development environment.
- an OpenGL, OpenGL ES or Vulkan extension loader.  There are already good
  extension loader libraries for the GL APIs.
- a user interface library.  It allows you to create top-level windows with
  OpenGL and OpenGL ES contexts and Vulkan surfaces.  No menus, no buttons.
- a Windows-only library.  Requests for features that cannot be portably
  implemented will be denied unless they are unobtrusive, like the Windows port
  looking for a `GLFW_ICON` resource at window creation.
- a threading library.  There are already good cross-platform threading
  libraries and threading has been added to both the C11 and C++11 standard
  libraries.
- an image loading library.  There are already good cross-platform image loading
  libraries.
- capable of rendering text.  There are already several libraries that render
  text with OpenGL and consistent cross-platform text rendering cannot depend
  on the platform's text rendering facilities anyway.
- capable of rendering anything at all.  Rendering is up to you and/or other
  libraries.
- integrated with *any* user interface toolkit on *any* platform.  Good UI
  toolkits already provide OpenGL-capable widgets and having two libraries both
  talking to the vast global state of a window system is asking for trouble.
- able to play back sound.
- GLUT or SDL.


### 1.3 - Why yet another OpenGL library?

There are several other libraries available for aiding OpenGL development.  The
most common ones are [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/), an Open
Source implementation of GLUT, and [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/).

However, freeglut is mostly concerned with providing a stable clone of GLUT,
while SDL is too large for some people and has never had OpenGL as its main
focus.

We therefore believe that there is room for a lightweight, modern library for
managing OpenGL contexts, windows and input.


### 1.4 - What platforms are supported by GLFW?

Currently, GLFW supports Windows (XP and later), macOS (10.8 Mountain Lion and
later) and Unix-like operating systems with the X Window System, such as Linux,
FreeBSD and Cygwin.  Support for Wayland is available but not yet feature
complete.

GLFW is designed to be as portable as possible, and the code has been written
with portability in mind.


### 1.5 - What versions of OpenGL are supported by GLFW?

__TL;DR__ All versions supported by your operating system, driver and GPU.

This question likely stems from the original version of the
[`WGL_ARB_create_context`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/WGL_ARB_create_context.txt)
and
[`GLX_ARB_create_context`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/GLX_ARB_create_context.txt)
extensions, which stated that the old context creation mechanism would be
limited to OpenGL version 2.1.  However, this is no longer the case and the
specifications have been updated accordingly.

GLFW 2.6 and earlier use only the older context creation mechanism, which
on Windows and X11 may return contexts of any version, however new, provided
they implement the
[`ARB_compatibility`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_compatibility.txt)
extension.  Most modern drivers do this.

Explicit creation of OpenGL contexts of version 3.0 and above on Windows and
X11, including profiles and flags, is supported by GLFW 2.7 and later.

However, macOS did not support OpenGL 3.0 or later at the time that GLFW 2.7 was
released, and the support that Apple has since added only includes
forward-compatible OpenGL 3.2 core profile contexts.  Additionally, creating
such contexts requires new code, so older versions of GLFW cannot create OpenGL
3.0 contexts on macOS.

The first version of GLFW to support creation of OpenGL 3.2 contexts on macOS was
2.7.2.

## General

### 2.1 - Why use separate red/green/blue bit depths?

Because that is how most platforms describe OpenGL-capable pixel formats and how
OpenGL describes its framebuffers.  It makes GLFW more consistent with the APIs
it interacts with, and more future-proof.

This doesn't, of course, prevent you from presenting the familiar, single value
color depths to the user.


### 2.2 - Is it possible to change video modes after a window has been created?

You can change the resolution of a full screen window with `glfwSetWindowSize`,
but the pixel format, i.e. the framebuffer bit depths will remain the same.
Changing the pixel format requires the context to be recreated.


### 2.3 - Will image or texture loading support be added to GLFW?

No.


### 2.4 - Will sound support be added to GLFW?

No.

However, if you are looking for an OpenGL-like API for sound, have a look at
OpenAL.


### 2.5 - Will font or text rendering support be added to GLFW?

No.

There are already several competent font rendering toolkits available for
OpenGL, none of which require integration with a context or window management
library.


### 2.6 - Will pop-up menu support be added to GLFW?

No.


### 2.7 - Will message box support be added to GLFW?

Not right now.

The main issue keeping this from being added is the lack of a standard,
Unicode-enabled UI toolkit on Unix-like systems such as Linux and FreeBSD.
Depending on, say, Gtk+, would therefore introduce a dependency on a huge amount
of code not necessarily present on the user's machine.

As there is no reason why message box code has to be integrated into GLFW,
it is better to leave that functionality to a separate library.


### 2.8 - What is Unicode?

**Unicode** (sometimes referred to as ISO 10646), is a character coding standard
that encodes virtually every character from every written language in the world
into a common character set. It is gaining acceptance worldwide, and today most
platforms, computer languages and APIs have some sort of support for Unicode
(GLFW now being one of them).

*Visit
[The Unicode Consortium](https://www.unicode.org)
for more information about Unicode.*

*See also
[Wikipedia on Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).*


### 2.9 - Is GLFW thread safe?

Some parts are, specifically those needed to allow rendering and Vulkan object
creation from secondary threads.  See [Thread
Safety](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/intro.html#thread_safety) in the
documentation for details.


### 2.10 - Can I check several keys at once?

Yes, you can.

The function `glfwGetKey` lets you check the state of any keyboard key
(including special keys). You can even call the function from within a callback
function, which makes it possible to check for things like Ctrl+F3 key events
(when you get a `GLFW_KEY_F3` key press event, check the state of the left or
right CTRL key with `glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_LEFT_CONTROL)` or
`glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_RIGHT_CONTROL)`, or both).


### 2.11 - What timer APIs does GLFW use?

On Windows, the `QueryPerformanceCounter` API is used if available, with
`timeGetTime` as a fallback.

On macOS, the Mach `mach_absolute_time` time source is used.

On Unix-like operating systems using the X11 and Wayland ports, the POSIX
`CLOCK_MONOTONIC` time source is used if available, with `gettimeofday` as
a fallback.


### 2.12 - What window system APIs does GLFW use?

On Windows, plain Win32 is used for window and input management, and WGL or EGL
to create OpenGL and OpenGL ES contexts.

On macOS, Cocoa is used for window and input management, and NSOpenGL to create
OpenGL contexts.

On Unix-like systems using the X Window System, the Xlib API is used for window
and input management, and GLX or EGL to create OpenGL and OpenGL ES contexts.

On Linux systems using Wayland, the Wayland API is used for window and input
management, and EGL to create OpenGL and OpenGL ES contexts.


### 2.13 - Why doesn't your gl.h have the functions I need?

GLFW does not provide any version of either `gl.h` or `glu.h`.  The `glfw3.h`
header file includes the versions already present in your development
environment.

However, if you are using Windows, you cannot get anything newer than
OpenGL 1.2 without using extensions.  As the extension management in GLFW is
very rudimentary, we recommend that you use a dedicated extension loading
library such as [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad).


### 2.14 - Why do my objects look all wrong?

GLFW does not wrap OpenGL.  No GLFW code is involved when you make an OpenGL
call.  Think instead of GLFW as connecting your code to OpenGL and then getting
out of the way.  That connection is the OpenGL context you create and make
current with GLFW.  If you get incorrect rendering results, it is therefore most
likely due to errors in your code, the OpenGL implementation or both.

The OpenGL.org wiki has an extensive article on
[common mistakes](https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Common_Mistakes) that may be
able to help you locate the problem.


### 2.15 - Can I use extension loaders with GLFW?

Yes, as long as you prevent the GLFW header from including the platform client
API header (for example `gl.h` for OpenGL).  There are two ways to do this.
Either include the extension loader header before including the GLFW header:

{% highlight c %}
#include <glad/glad.h>
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
{% endhighlight %}

The extension loader header will disable and replace the standard OpenGL header
that the GLFW header includes.  You can also disable the standard OpenGL header
yourself by defining `GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE` before including the GLFW header.  This
will let you include the GLFW and extension loader headers in any order:

{% highlight c %}
#define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <glad/glad.h>
{% endhighlight %}


### 2.16 - How do I use C++ methods as callbacks?

You cannot use regular methods as callbacks, as GLFW is a C library and doesn't
know about objects and `this` pointers.  If you wish to receive callbacks to
a C++ object, use static methods or regular functions as callbacks, store the
pointer to the object you wish to call as the user pointer for the window and
use it to call methods on your object.

## Windows

### 3.1 - What compilers are supported by GLFW?

Currently, GLFW releases are tested with MinGW, MinGW-w64 and Visual C++ 2010,
2012, 2013 and 2015, but it should work with any compiler that supports C99 (C89
on Windows).  Very old development environments may require updated system
headers.

The Windows binary distribution of GLFW contains pre-compiled libraries
for both MinGW and the most recent versions of Visual C++.


### 3.2 - Why do I get link errors when trying to build my program?

See the
[Building programs that use GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html)
guide for details on how to compile and link programs on various platforms.


### 3.3 - Why doesn't glfwSwapInterval work?

Modern graphics drivers have settings that allow users to override an
application's request for (among other things) swap interval.  If such a setting
is enabled, `glfwSwapInterval` will have no effect.


### 3.4 - What libraries should I link with?

See the
[Building programs that use GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html)
guide for details.                 


### 3.5 - Why does my application freeze when I move or resize the window?

The Windows event loop is blocked by certain actions like dragging or resizing
a window, or opening the window menu.  This is part of the design of Windows and
cannot be changed by GLFW.  If you wish to keep rendering during such actions,
you should render from a secondary thread.

## macOS

### 4.1 - How do I create an OpenGL 3.0+ context?

The only OpenGL 3.x and 4.x contexts currently supported by macOS are
forward-compatible, core profile contexts.  The supported versions are 3.2
on 10.7 Lion and 3.3 and 4.1 on 10.9 Mavericks.  In all cases, your GPU needs to
support the specified OpenGL version for context creation to succeed.

To create either an OpenGL 3.2 or later context, you should set the following
hints:

{% highlight c %}
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 2);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);
{% endhighlight %}

This will give you a context for the highest version of OpenGL greater than or
equal to 3.2 that is supported by your OS and GPU.  This works because no
features were deprecated between OpenGL 3.2 and 4.1, making forward-compatible
OpenGL 4.1 backards-compatible with 3.2.  If the requested version is not
supported, window creation will fail.           

If your code requires OpenGL 3.3 or 4.1, you can specify those versions instead,
as well as any valid OpenGL version in between.


### 4.2 - What libraries should I link with?

See the
[Building programs that use GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html)
guide for details.                 


### 4.3 - Why is my output in the lower-left corner of the window?

You are passing the window size, which is in screen coordinates, to
`glViewport`, which works with pixels.  On macOS with a Retina display, and
possibly on other platforms in the future, screen coordinates and pixels do not
map 1:1.  Use the framebuffer size, which is in pixels, instead of the window
size.  See the
[Window handling guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html) for
details.

[Building programs that use GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html)
